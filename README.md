# SE-Assignment-6
 Assignment: Introduction to Python
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of Python programming. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

 Questions:

1. Python Basics:
   - What is Python, and what are some of its key features that make it popular among developers? Provide examples of use cases where Python is particularly effective.

 Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. 
 Its key features include:
Ease of Learning and Use: Pythonâ€™s syntax is simple and clear, making it easy for beginners to learn and use.
Interpreted Language: Python is executed line by line, which helps in debugging and development.
Versatility: Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.
Extensive Libraries and Frameworks: Python has a vast standard library and many third-party libraries for various tasks such as web development (Django, Flask), data analysis (Pandas, NumPy), machine learning (scikit-learn, TensorFlow), and more.
Community Support: Python has a large and active community that contributes to its development and offers support to developers.
Use Cases:
Web Development: Django and Flask are popular web frameworks.
Data Science and Machine Learning: Libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn are widely used.
Automation and Scripting: Python is often used for writing scripts to automate tasks.
Software Development: Python can be used for developing desktop applications and games.  

2. Installing Python:
   - Describe the steps to install Python on your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux). Include how to verify the installation and set up a virtual environment.

Windows:
Download the installer from the official Python website.
Run the installer and check the box "Add Python to PATH."
Select "Install Now" and follow the prompts.
Verify the installation by opening Command Prompt and running:
python --version
macOS:
Open the Terminal.
Install Homebrew if not already installed:
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
Use Homebrew to install Python:
brew install python
Verify the installation by running:
python3 --version
Linux:
Open the Terminal.
Install Python using the package manager:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3
Verify the installation by running:
python3 --version
Setting up a Virtual Environment:
Install the venv module if not already installed:
python3 -m pip install --user virtualenv
Create a virtual environment:
python3 -m venv myenv
Activate the virtual environment:
Windows:
.\myenv\Scripts\activate
macOS/Linux:
source myenv/bin/activate  

3. Python Syntax and Semantics:
   - Write a simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. Explain the basic syntax elements used in the program.

python
print("Hello, World!")
Explanation:
print: A built-in function that outputs text to the console.
"Hello, World!": A string literal enclosed in double quotes.

4. Data Types and Variables:
   - List and describe the basic data types in Python. Write a short script that demonstrates how to create and use variables of different data types.

Basic Data Types:
int: Integer numbers.
float: Floating-point numbers.
str: Strings, or text data.
bool: Boolean values (True or False).
list: Ordered, mutable collections.
tuple: Ordered, immutable collections.
dict: Key-value pairs.
set: Unordered collections of unique elements.
Script:
python
# Integer
age = 25
print("Age:", age)
# Float
height = 5.9
print("Height:", height)
# String
name = "Alice"
print("Name:", name)
# Boolean
is_student = True
print("Is Student:", is_student)
# List
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print("Fruits:", fruits)
# Tuple
coordinates = (10.0, 20.0)
print("Coordinates:", coordinates)
# Dictionary
student = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25, "is_student": True}
print("Student Info:", student)
# Set
unique_numbers = {1, 2, 3, 3, 4}
print("Unique Numbers:", unique_numbers)  

5. Control Structures:
   - Explain the use of conditional statements and loops in Python. Provide examples of an `if-else` statement and a `for` loop.

Conditional Statements:
Conditional statements allow the execution of certain code blocks based on conditions.
Example:
python
x = 10
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
else:
    print("x is 5 or less")
Loops:
Loops allow the execution of a code block multiple times.
Example of a for loop:
python
for i in range(5):
    print(i) 

6. Functions in Python:
   - What are functions in Python, and why are they useful? Write a Python function that takes two arguments and returns their sum. Include an example of how to call this function.

Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task. They help in organizing code, making it more modular, and promoting code reuse.
Example Function:
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
# Calling the function
result = add(3, 5)
print("Sum:", result)

7. Lists and Dictionaries:
   - Describe the differences between lists and dictionaries in Python. Write a script that creates a list of numbers and a dictionary with some key-value pairs, then demonstrates basic operations on both.

Lists: Ordered collections of items, accessed by index.
Dictionaries: Unordered collections of key-value pairs, accessed by keys.
Script:
# List of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print("Numbers:", numbers)
numbers.append(6)
print("Updated Numbers:", numbers)
# Dictionary of key-value pairs
person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25, "city": "New York"}
print("Person:", person)
person["age"] = 26
print("Updated Person:", person)  

8. Exception Handling:
   - What is exception handling in Python? Provide an example of how to use `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks to handle errors in a Python script.

Exception handling is a mechanism to handle runtime errors, ensuring the program continues running smoothly.
Example:
try:
    result = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Error: Division by zero is not allowed.")
finally:
    print("This block is always executed.")  

9. Modules and Packages:
   - Explain the concepts of modules and packages in Python. How can you import and use a module in your script? Provide an example using the `math` module.

Modules: Single files containing Python code, which can be imported and used in other scripts.
Packages: Collections of modules organized in directories.
Example:
import math
# Using functions from the math module
print("Square root of 16:", math.sqrt(16))
print("Pi value:", math.pi)

10. File I/O:
    - How do you read from and write to files in Python? Write a script that reads the content of a file and prints it to the console, and another script that writes a list of strings to a file.

Reading from a file:
with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
Writing to a file:
lines = ["Line 1", "Line 2", "Line 3"]
with open('output.txt', 'w') as file:
    for line in lines:
        file.write(line + "\n") 

# Submission Guidelines:
- Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
- Provide code snippets or complete scripts where applicable.
- Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
- Submit your completed assignment by [due date].
